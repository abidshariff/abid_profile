                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>As a Senior Data Engineer at Amazon on the Workforce Intelligence team, I play a key role in delivering critical analytics that empower our Talent Acquisition team to enhance features within Amazon's internal hiring platforms. I build centralized data platforms that are used daily by thousands of users - recruiting coordinators, hiring managers, and senior executives - to improve the candidate experience and reduce hiring costs. Additionally, I've designed and implemented real-time analytics solutions that have optimized workload management for over a million hourly associates globally. My work also includes developing reusable solutions to streamline batch and real-time data transformation pipelines, providing self-service analytics for stakeholders.</p>
